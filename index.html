    <h1>About CrocoDuck</h1>
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        CrocoDuck was founded in 2019 by two passionate parents, Emily and Michael, who were constantly on the hunt for new and engaging toys to spark their two children's curiosity and imagination. Frustrated by the lack of variety in toy stores and the hassle of constantly shopping for new toys, they decided to create a subscription service that would bring the joy and wonder of discovery right to families' doorsteps.
      </p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to inspire creativity, learning, and endless fun for children aged 0-10 years old. We carefully curate each box with a thoughtful selection of high-quality, educational, and age-appropriate toys that encourage exploration, problem-solving, and imaginative play.
      </p>
    <h2>Our Promise</h2>
      <p>
        We understand the importance of providing children with toys that not only entertain but are also safe,  fostering their cognitive, social, and emotional development. That's why our team of experts meticulously handpicks each item, ensuring that every toy in our boxes meets the highest standards of safety, durability, and educational value.
